In this work, we work out the bisection method algorithm. The method lies in the fact that we have a continuous function, for which we take an interval, for the interval we select boundaries that are different in sign. (a<0 & b >0, for example). We divide the segment in half, change one of the parameters of the interval boundary (a or b) so that they all also differ in sign. This continues until we reach the required measurement error and find the root of the function given to us.
